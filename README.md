# Awesome LLM systems [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository aims to consolidate resources for learning about systems for LLM. I have attempted to compile a list of resources (blogs/papers) that are essential for building a fundamental knowledge of the field. This is by no means exhaustive. The criteria for a resource to be in this list are:

1. It is simple (not necessarily easy!) to follow
2. It is fundamental to the domain of systems and LLM, i.e, it is either widely adopted or has a critical idea explored
3. It is good for someone starting in the area or someone with intermediate knowledge in the field
